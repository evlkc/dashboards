confidence level
From here, the next logical feature steps are:

Trade analytics panel

Histogram of trade returns

Best / worst trade

Average holding period

Maybe avg R multiple

Normalized equity curves

Option to show both curves starting at 100 so you can actually see the strategy line when buy & hold goes 15×.

Presets

Dropdown like: “Zaheer-style default”, “Looser flags”, “Tighter trend filter” that auto-sets the sidebar values.

Multi-ticker scanner

Input a list of tickers (or a preset list)

Run the model on each

Show which had the best CAGR / are currently in or near a setup

If you tell me which of those you want to tackle next, I can drop in the concrete code changes for that piece only.
